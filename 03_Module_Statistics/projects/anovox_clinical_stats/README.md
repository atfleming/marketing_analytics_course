ANOVOX CLINICAL PROGRAM STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Primary Endpoint Analysis:
• Treatment A vs Control: Mean difference = X.X points (95% CI: Y.Y to Z.Z)
• Statistical significance: p = 0.XXX
• Clinical significance: XX% achieved MCID (≥10 points)
• Effect size: Cohen's d = X.XX (large effect)

Secondary Endpoints:
• Response rate: XX% vs XX% (p = 0.XXX, NNT = X)
• Quality of life: Significant improvement (p < 0.05)
• Safety profile: No significant difference in adverse events

Regulatory Considerations:
• Intent-to-treat analysis conducted
• Missing data handled appropriately
• Multiple comparisons adjusted (Bonferroni)
• Clinical significance demonstrated alongside statistical significance
